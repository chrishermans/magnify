## How does it work?

It uses the Windows [Magnification API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/_magapi/) for the main functionality, and Win32 APIs to control the window.

This program is designed to run in the background and consumes very little resources when not active. 
After you run it, an icon will appear in the notification area.

It relies a low level keyboard hook to set up global hotkeys that are used to interact with the functionality.

When it is toggled on, there is a periodic timer that refreshes the magnification lens.

## Installation

Because this program requires access to the Windows UI in order to properly magnify certain Windows 10 elements, it is compiled with a manifest file in order to set the uiAccess level to `true`.

However, windows will only allow such executables to run if they are signed, and reside within a secure location such as `%systemdrive%\Program Files\` for example. [More on this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/user-account-control-only-elevate-uiaccess-applications-that-are-installed-in-secure-locations).
